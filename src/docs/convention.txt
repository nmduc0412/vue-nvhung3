--- Component Recommended Rules ---
1. When possible each component should be defined in its own dedicated file (SFC)
2. Single File components should be named in PascalCase
- UserList.vue, UserForm.vue
3. Base components should all start with the same prefix (like Base or App)
- AppButton.vue (BaseButton.vue), AppPopup.vue (BasePopup.vue)
4. Component names should always be multi-worded to not conflict with any existing or future HTML elements.
Don't create a Table or a Button component.
5. Single instance components should begin with the prefix The: TheHeader.vue, TheSidebar.vue
6. Tightly coupled child components should be prefixed with their parent component's name
- For instance a TodoListItem in a TodoList
- This groups them together and declares them related
7. Component names should begin with the most top level (usually general) words and end with the most specific
- Such as SearchWidgetInput, SearchWidgetResultsList, SearchWidget
- This groups related components together in the file structure
